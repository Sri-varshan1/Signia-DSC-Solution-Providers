                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Logo design is all about creating the perfect visual brand mark for a company. 
                    Depending on the type, a logo usually consists of a symbol or brandmark and a logotype, 
                    along with a tagline.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    A Logo is a is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public 
                    identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include 
                    the text of the name it represents as in a wordmark.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast 
                    as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF Garamond), as opposed to
                    a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word. 
                    By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface 
                    or colophon. At the level of mass communication and in common usage, a company's 
                    logo is today often synonymous with its trademark or brand
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), 
                    especially for logos translated into many alphabets in increasingly globalized 
                    markets. For instance, a name written in Arabic script might have little resonance 
                    in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms keep the general proprietary nature 
                    of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the Red Cross (varied as the Red 
                    Crescent in Muslim countries and as the Red Star of David in Israel) exemplifies a 
                    well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent a
                    re among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent 
                    Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross 
                    include these symbols in their logos.

                    Branding can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing. 
                    Consumers and potential consumers can identify the Coca-Cola name written in 
                    different alphabets because of the standard color and "ribbon wave" design of its logo. 
                    The text was written in Spencerian Script, which was a popular writing style when the 
                    Coca-Cola Logo was being designed
