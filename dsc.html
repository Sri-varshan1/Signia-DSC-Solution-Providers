                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity 
                    of a message, software or digital document. It's the digital equivalent of a handwritten 
                    signature or stamped seal, but it offers far more inherent security. A digital signature is 
                    intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Digital signatures can provide evidence of origin, identity and status of electronic documents, 
                    transactions or digital messages. Signers can also use them to acknowledge informed consent.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    In many countries, including the United States, digital signatures are considered legally 
                    binding in the same way as traditional handwritten document signatures.

                <h2 class="worksingle-heading h3 pb-3 light-300 typo-space-line">How do Digital signature works</h2>
                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. 
                    Using a public key algorithm, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), two keys are generated, 
                    creating a mathematically linked pair of keys, one private and one public.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Digital signatures work through public key cryptography's two mutually authenticating cryptographic keys. 
                    The individual who creates the digital signature uses a private key to encrypt signature-related data, 
                    while the only way to decrypt that data is with the signer's public key.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    If the recipient can't open the document with the signer's public key, that's a sign there's a problem 
                    with the document or the signature. This is how digital signatures are authenticated.
                </p>

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Digital signature technology requires all parties trust that the individual creating the signature 
                    has kept the private key secret. If someone else has access to the private signing key, that party 
                    could create fraudulent digital signatures in the name of the private key holder.

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    Industries use digital signature technology to streamline processes and improve document integrity. 
                    Industries that use digital signatures include the following:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Government.</strong> The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) publishes electronic versions of budgets, 
                            public and private laws, and congressional bills with digital signatures. Digital signatures are used by 
                            governments worldwide for a variety of reasons, including processing tax returns, verifying 
                            business-to-government (B2G) transactions, ratifying laws and managing contracts. Most government entities 
                            must adhere to strict laws, regulations and standards when using digital signatures. Many governments and 
                            corporations also use smart cards to ID their citizens and employees. These are physical cards endowed 
                            with a digital signature that can be used to give the cardholder access to an institution's systems or 
                            physical buildings.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Healthcare.</strong> Digital signatures are used in the healthcare industry to improve the efficiency 
                            of treatment and administrative processes, to strengthen data security, for e-prescribing and hospital admissions. 
                            The use of digital signatures in healthcare must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
                            Act (HIPAA) of 1996.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Manufacturing.</strong> Manufacturing companies use digital signatures to speed up processes, 
                            including product design, quality assurance (QA), manufacturing enhancements, marketing and sales. 
                            The use of digital signatures in manufacturing is governed by the International Organization for 
                            Standardization (ISO) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Manufacturing 
                            Certificate (DMC).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Financial Services.</strong> The U.S. financial sector uses digital signatures for contracts, 
                            paperless banking, loan processing, insurance documentation, mortgages and more. This heavily regulated 
                            sector uses digital signatures with careful attention to the regulations and guidance put forth by the 
                            Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), state Uniform Electronic Transactions 
                            Act (UETA) regulations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Financial Institutions 
                            Examination Council (FFIEC).

                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cryptocurrencies.</strong> Digital signatures are also used in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 
                            to authenticate the blockchain. They are also used to manage transaction data associated with cryptocurrency 
                            and as a way for users to show ownership of currency or their participation in a transaction.

                <p class="worksingle-footer py-3 text-muted light-300">
                    There are three different classes of digital signature certificates (DSCs):

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Class 1.</strong> Cannot be used for legal business documents as they are validated based 
                            only on an email ID and username. Class 1 signatures provide a basic level of security and are used 
                            in environments with a low risk of data compromise.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Class 2.</strong> Often used for electronic filing (e-filing) of tax documents, 
                            including income tax returns and goods and services tax (GST) returns. Class 2 digital 
                            signatures authenticate a signer's identity against a pre-verified database. Class 2 digital 
                            signatures are used in environments where the risks and consequences of data compromise are moderate.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Class 3.</strong> The highest level of digital signatures, Class 3 signatures require a 
                            person or organization to present in front of a certifying authority to prove their identity before 
                            signing. Class 3 digital signatures are used for e-auctions, e-tendering, e-ticketing, court filings 
                            and in other environments where threats to data or the consequences of a security failure are high.
